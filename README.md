## How does it work?
Game creates static board object, sets up pieces on initial positions, show them in GUI.
When user clicks on buttons, ActionListener is called. If buttons clicked is a valid move game GUI updates.

To know more I recomend you to check out classes Main, Board, and Square located at src/game.

## How do I test it?
You can download .zip file of game src, compile and run in on your machine. 

This is the first game I wrote to test my skills in basic OOP consepts.
