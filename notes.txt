To Do:
    piece - label (to which mouse listener is applied)
                -> when pressed we know what piece is to be moved:  - check if the right player is playing
                                                                    - piece is changes color

                   when pressed to new coordinate: - check if move is valid -> move (piece is unclicked)
                                                   - coordinate of piece is changed


Future improvements:
    - show who's move it is in the corner
    - show possible moves when you select a piece


Stack exchange code:
    why does it have getPath?
